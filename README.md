🚁 Quadrotor Flight Dynamics Core (C++)

An engineering-grade flight dynamics infrastructure for developing and validating control and estimation algorithms.

A physics-accurate 6-DoF flight dynamics and estimation framework built from scratch in modern C++ for control verification and state estimator development.

Features

High-fidelity rigid-body flight dynamics (6-DoF)

Physically consistent thrust, torque, and actuator modeling

Modular sensor simulation and state estimation support (EKF/UKF ready)

Clean, minimal C++ core with zero heavy dependencies

Deterministic, real-time capable performance

Designed as a reusable dynamics engine rather than a script-based simulator

Easy integration with custom controllers and external toolchains

Extensible architecture for rapid experimentation and research

Built for engineers who care about dynamics fidelity, numerical stability, and full control over the physics stack.
