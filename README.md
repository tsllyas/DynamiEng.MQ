🚁 Quadrotor Flight Dynamics Core (C++)

An engineering-grade flight dynamics and estimation infrastructure for control verification and state estimator development.

Built from scratch in modern C++, this project provides a physics-accurate 6-DoF rigid-body dynamics engine with deterministic, real-time performance. It is designed as a reusable dynamics core rather than a high-level or script-based simulator, giving full control over the physics and numerical behavior.

Features

• High-fidelity 6-DoF rigid-body dynamics  
• Physically consistent thrust, torque, and actuator modeling  
• Modular sensor simulation and estimator support (EKF/UKF ready)  
• Clean, dependency-light C++ core  
• Deterministic and real-time capable  
• Easy integration with custom controllers and external toolchains  
• Extensible architecture for research and experimentation  

Designed for engineers who value physical correctness, numerical stability, and transparent system behavior.
