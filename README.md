🚁 Quadrotor Flight Dynamics Core (C++)

A lightweight, engineering-grade 6-DoF flight dynamics core for control and state estimation development.

Built from scratch in modern C++, this project provides deterministic, physics-accurate rigid-body simulation with realistic actuator and sensor modeling.
Designed as a reusable dynamics library, not a high-level simulator.

Features

- High-fidelity 6-DoF rigid-body dynamics

- Physically consistent thrust and torque modeling

- Realistic IMU / magnetometer simulation (white noise + bias drift)

- Estimator-ready sensor pipeline (EKF / UKF compatible)

- Deterministic and real-time capable

- Dependency-light modern C++

- Easy integration with custom controllers and toolchains

- Modular and extensible architecture

- Built for engineers who care about correctness, stability, and predictable system behavior.
